NAME

  analyze


SYNOPSIS

  analyze


DESCRIPTION

  Analyze progress over multiple days.  Compile totals for each food for each
  day, totals for each food overall, average points per day per food,
  percentage of overall points per food, total weight difference from start to
  end, and average weight difference per day.


BUGS

  Currently this function only handles the entire span of time with records.
  It might be good to provide targeting for smaller time ranges, and for
  granularity more course than a day.  For example, a week-by-week breakdown of
  average points per day and average weight change per day could be helpful.
