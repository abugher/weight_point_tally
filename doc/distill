NAME

  distill
  

SYNOPSIS

  distill
  

DESCRIPTION

  Filter out any non-number characters from stdin, and present the filtered
  output on stdout.


BUGS

  It might be better to just not do this, and throw an error if non-number text
  is presented where a number is expected.

  A string with multiple dot characters can be generated, which is not a valid
  number.
