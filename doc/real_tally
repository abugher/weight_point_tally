NAME

  real_tally


SYNOPSIS

  real_tally


DESCRIPTION

  This was formerly named tally, but tally is now a high level function
  available to the user.  In interactive mode, this function prompts the user
  for daily data, including weight and foods consumed, generating a definition
  for any unknown foods, and outputting the full point tally for the day at the
  end.  In noninteractive mode, it simply reads a list of daily consumed foods
  and outputs the total number of points for the day.


BUGS

  This function has a dumb name.
