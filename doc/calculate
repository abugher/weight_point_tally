NAME

  calculate


SYNOPSIS

  calculate <expression>


DESCRIPTION

  expression is expected to be a single string, and will be passed to bc.  The
  calculate function exists to handle and correct bc's weird behavior,
  specifically how it returns a successful exit code even if it actually
  encounters a fatal error.


BUGS

  This function looks like garbage.  It works perfectly well and is fairly
  compact, but it is very confusing looking.  On the other hand, its job is
  legitimately confusing, so that look is accurate.
