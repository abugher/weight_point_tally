NAME

  weigh-in


SYNOPSIS

  weigh-in


DESCRIPTION

  High level user-available function.  Weigh in for the day.  If a weight is
  already recorded, prompt the user to confirm overwriting that value.


BUGS

  This function's name is far too similar to another function name, weigh_in.

  weigh_in_assertively (another dumb name) could probably be eliminated, and
  its contents included directly in this function definition.
