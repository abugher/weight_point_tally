NAME

  sync_state


SYNOPSIS

  sync_state


DESCRIPTION

  Sync the current state (food definitions, weight and consumption records)
  both up and down, using g.  g is part of the git-automation framework, and
  assumed to be present.

  This is called at the beginning and end of every high level function.


BUGS

  g is assumed to be present.  git-automation should be a subproject and this
  function should explicitly reference g from that location.

  Syncing tends to break if I left tally running somewhere else.  This would
  happen less if instead of one long file, each day record consisted of a
  directory containing timestamp-named files with one food entry each.
